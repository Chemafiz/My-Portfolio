### An attempt to train a classical (without neural networks) machine learning model for recognizing numbers using MNIST dataset.

Done:  
- trained model and simple evaluation  
- a small program to recognize the numbers entered by the user in real time  
  
Work in progress:
- training the model with "more advanced" algorithms (random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, stacking)

In the future:  
- training the model with the artificial neural networks (I have to learn it :) )  



Example of running program:
