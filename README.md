# My Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio projects. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Loan Prediction classification - can i get a loan?](https://github.com/Chemafiz/portfolio/blob/main/loan_prediction.ipynb): Model for predicting credit decisions based on personal data. One of my first ML projects.  
	- [Spaceship titanic classification](https://github.com/Chemafiz/portfolio/blob/main/spaceship_titanic.ipynb): There was a disaster on board the spaceship. Some people have been transferred to another dimension. The model classifies passengers who have been transferred. My first attempt to build pipeline.
	- [Star type classification](https://github.com/Chemafiz/portfolio/blob/main/star_classification.ipynb): Astronomers categorize stars by type. Each type has its own unique parameters. The model classifies newly known stars based on this parameters. 

	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy 

- ### Micro Projects: 

	- __Python__
		- [Game of life](https://github.com/Chemafiz/portfolio/tree/main/game%20of%20life): Classic programming project with visualization.  
		- [Simulation of galaxy collision](https://github.com/Chemafiz/portfolio/tree/main/galaxy%20collision%20simulation): Simulating galaxy collisions with Python is not an easy task, but I tried my best :)
		- [Digits recognition](https://github.com/Chemafiz/portfolio/tree/main/digits%20recognition): The use of classical machine learning algorithms for the classification of numbers. The model was then used to make a small program to recognize the digits entered by the user in real-time.
