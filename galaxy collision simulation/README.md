# galaxy-collision-simulation
This is numeric simulation of two colliding galaxies. Program is not very complicated, but it uses real gravity equations to calculate "stars" and "galaxies" position in real-time.
Graphic was done with PyGame library.
Because "while" loop (and generaly few others loops) is the main core of running program, it was hard to gain some good efficiency (Python doesn't like loops)
To achieve good FPS ,with at least 2000 stars, I used NumPy array.


Here we can see screenshot of running program with two colliding galaxies and below  we can see two REAL galaxies colliding to each other.
I think there is some kind of similarity between them :)
